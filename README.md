# Prompts

This repository contains the (growing) collection of prompts I have found beneficial in my life.  

The file *Prompt-Template.md* is a template for creating new prompts using Markdown.  ChatGPT and Claud.ai understand Markdown as input.  In order to execute a prompt, view the prompt's "code" then copy and paste the Markdown into the chatbot.

The structure of the *Prompt-Template.md" file is based on some research I conducted on prompt engineering.  The sections have helped me think about the outcome I want to achieve and how I want to go about achieving it.  

I applied this structure to create the *Dog-or-Cat-Model-Prompt* after I wrote my initial prompt to ask a ChatGPT to create the model code (see [*Lessons Learned from Creating Code with Generative AI](https://dphummel.github.io/CreatingCode.html)). This exercise helped me realize what I documented in the prompt was actually the thought process I went through in determining how to achieve the desired outcome with the model.  Rather than keeping this information in my head and using it to guide my actions, I documented it so I could have an AI-assistant take the defined actions to achieve the outcome with me as the human in the loop.

Here is a list of the prompts in this repository:

- **Negotiation-Prompt**: Teach negotiation skills.  Original source:  Elan Mollick in the book *Co-Intelligence* (page xiv).
- **Rashomon-AI-Prompt**: Combat cognitive biases by provide alternative narratives as to the cause of a situation.  Original source:  Confluence for 7.14.2024.
- **Dog-or-Cat-Model-Prompt**: Generate a Jupyter notebook to create a computer vision model to determine if a image is a dog or a cat. I have used this prompt to analyze how various chatbots create code.
