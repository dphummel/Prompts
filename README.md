# Prompts

This repository contains a (growing) collection of prompts I have found beneficial in my life.

The file Prompt-Template.md is a template for creating new prompts using Markdown. ChatGPT and Claude.ai understand Markdown as input. To execute a prompt, view the prompt’s “code” then copy and paste the Markdown into the chatbot.

The structure of the Prompt-Template.md file is based on some research I conducted on prompt engineering. The sections have helped me think about the outcome I want to achieve and how I want to go about achieving it.

I applied this structure to create the Dog-or-Cat-Model-Prompt after I wrote my initial prompt asking ChatGPT to create the model code (see [*Lessons Learned from Creating Code with Generative AI*](https://dphummel.github.io/CreatingCode.html)). This exercise helped me realize that what I documented in the prompt was actually the thought process I went through in determining how to achieve the desired outcome with the model. Rather than keeping this information in my head and using it to guide my actions, I documented it so I could have an AI assistant take the defined actions to achieve the outcome, with me as the human in the loop.

Here is a list of the prompts in this repository:

- **Negotiation-Prompt**: Teach negotiation skills. Original source: Elan Mollick in the book Co-Intelligence (page xiv).
- **Rashomon-AI-Prompt**: Combat cognitive biases by providing alternative narratives as to the cause of a situation. Original source: Confluence for 7.14.2024.
- **Dog-or-Cat-Model-Prompt**: Generate a Jupyter notebook to create a computer vision model to determine if an image is a dog or a cat. I have used this prompt to analyze how various chatbots create code.
